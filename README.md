# ACO-29City-TSP

The target problem in this question is the 29-city TSP (known as Bays29 in literature). The
distance between cities is symmetrical, and Euclidean distance measure is used. Each city must be
visited once and only once. The objective is to minimize the sum of the Euclidean distances of a complete TSP tour. Ignore curvature of the earth. The 29 city coordinate matrix is provided in an excel file.

Code a simple ACO algorithm to solve the problem. Select a transition rule, select an online delayed pheromone update rule, set a population size and select a stopping criterion. Justify your selections based on the problem and what you learnt in this course.
